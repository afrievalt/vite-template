- avoid useState
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Keep components small and focused (max 120 lines)


- An ideal react component is too small to fail
    * Max component size 60 lines, file 120 lines
    * Keep code DRY
    * Break down larger components into smaller ones.  
        + One components per file
        + Use folders structures to mirror JSX structure.  
            JSX structure example: 
                <HomePage>
                    <Menu/>
                    <MainSection>
                        <Summary>
                        <PersonTable>
                    </MainSection>
                </HomePage>
            Folder structure example: 
                HomePage/
                ├── HomePage.tsx
                ├── Menu.tsx
                └── MainSection/
                │   ├── MainSection.tsx
                │   ├── Summary.tsx
                │   └── PersonTable.tsx
                └── ...
                    

        
- An ideal react component has a minimal surface area.
    * Avoid prop drilling
    * Prefer injecting values with useSelector
    * Property naming convention:
        + Use meaningful prop names
        + use camel case
        + booleans should begin with "is"
        + callbacks should begin with "on"
        + avoid ambiguous names like data, list, items or a single letter
    * Prefer simple primitive values.
        + Avoid parameters that require parsing
    * Use default values
    
- An ideal react component has minimal logic.
    * Avoid empty checks
    * Use lookup tables
    * Move logic outside the component.
    * Use selectors
    * Use CSS 
    * JSX should only have one return


- An ideal react component has a clear separation between JavaScript and JSX.

    * Never create helper functions that return JSX
    * Define event handlers outside your JSX

- An ideal react component has jsx that resembles simple html.
    * Avoid long classNames
    * Limit JavaScript in you JSX
    * Avoid render props
    * Avoid dot notation in components
