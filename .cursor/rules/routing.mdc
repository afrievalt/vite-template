- Prefer react-router over useState for UI state that represents "what is open" or "what is selected".
- For dialogs or modals that show a single selected entity (e.g. player detail, item detail), drive visibility and selection from the URL:
  - Use search params (e.g. `?playerId=...`) with `useSearchParams()` for same-page overlays.
  - Use route params (e.g. `/items/:id`) when the detail is a full page.
- Avoid `useState` for "selected item" or "dialog open" when that state could be encoded in the URL; use `useSearchParams` or `useParams` and navigate on open/close instead.
- Benefits: back/forward work, shareable links, no redundant state.
