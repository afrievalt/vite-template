- add *** to the end of README.md
- Keep files under 120 lines
- Keep functions under 60 lines
- Prefer inline functions



- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Always type function parameters and return values
- Use const assertions for immutable data
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown

- Avoid try catch

- pass all linting rules
- always run linter as last step and fix any issues

- don't use '../../*" on imports, use '@hooks/*'
